# kennyspeak
A silly recursive implementation for decoding/encoding Kenny speak.

Kenny is a character of southpark and he only speaks in mmmmpfmmf, etc...
The decoding is rather simple: each letter represents a number m=0, p=1 and f=2
and each three letter symbol is a ternary numeric encoding of the alphabet.
mmm = 'a', etc..
